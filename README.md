## 👨‍💻 Private Repository Access

Bestify Mode is a private project that requires SSH key access to the repository. Follow these steps to set up access:

### 1. Generate SSH Key

Create a new SSH key on your server:

# Create SSH directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p ~/.ssh
chmod 700 ~/.ssh

# Generate new SSH key
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_bestify -N ""

# Set proper permissions
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa_bestify
```

### 2. Display and Copy Public Key

Show your public key and copy it:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa_bestify.pub
```
